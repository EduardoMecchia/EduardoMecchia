# Hi!

My name's Eduardo. I'm a web development student from near Rome and I'm currently attending the Boolean Careers course. I'm studying HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL. I have also used Bootstrap and Vue.js and I'll study Laravel in the near future. I'm constantly thinking about cool and original ideas for new web applications.
